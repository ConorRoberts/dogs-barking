This framework is then applied to the following aspects of animal behaviour: foraging, anti-predator responses, sleep, sociality, mating, parental behaviour, play, dispersal and territoriality, animal intelligence, and behavioural pathologies.",

This experience may be based in a museum department, gallery, artist's studio, or arts publication office. The course should result in a substantial piece of work - for example, preparatory work for an exhibition, an analysis of a segment of a permanent collection, or a survey or catalogue of an artist's archives. The student is required to submit a written report upon completion of the course.",

Through the investigation of these timeless questions, we will participate in \"the great conversation\" that has shaped the world in which we live. This course continues the historical approach to the central problems of philosophy.

Students will derive an understanding of the biological foundation of their own health as an adult and will be encouraged to expand the concepts and processes of individual health to human populations, animals and the environment. Through lectures, laboratories, small group tutorials and an individual research project, students will gain an introduction to research in the health sciences. Students lacking Grade 12 or 4U Biology should consult with their program counsellor prior to taking BIOL*1080 in first semester.",

By relating these concepts to their daily lives, through analysis of problems and tutorial discussions, students will develop an understanding of five central themes: 1) all living things share common properties, 2) the cell is the fundamental functional unit of life, 3) managing energy is central to success, 4) genes are the fundamental information unit of life, and 5) heredity. Students lacking Grade 12 or 4U Biology should consult with their program counsellor prior to taking BIOL*1090 in first semester.",

Students independently conduct and write reports about 2 research projects of their choice and design (in consultation with faculty members), on any of: vertebrate, invertebrate, or plant ecology, and/or behaviour, in terrestrial or aquatic habitats. Emphasis is placed upon students asking ecological questions, designing experiments, and then collecting data from intensive field work. There are no formal lectures, but an organizational meeting is held in the winter semester prior to the field course. The charge by the field station for room and board will be passed on to the student. Students are also responsible for their own transportation to and from the field station. A departmental application form must be submitted for approval at least 4 weeks prior to the last day of course selection for the Summer semester, and the signature of the course coordinator will be required to select the course. This course must be recorded as part of your Fall course selection and tuition and compulsory fees will be calculated accordingly. Students taking this course DO NOT use course numbers reserved for Ontario Universities Program in Field Biology. Detailed information is available from the Department of Integrative Biology.",

      "description": "Review of Boolean algebra and truth tables, Karnaugh maps. Design, synthesis and realization of combinational circuits. Design, synthesis and realization of sequential circuits. VHDL: structural modeling, data flow modeling, synchronous &amp; asynchronous behavior descriptions, algorithmic modeling. Designing with PLDs. Digital design with SM charts. Designing with PGAs and complex programmable logical devices. Hardware testing and design for testability. Hierarchy in large designs. The course will primarily be concerned with the design of multi-input, multi-output digital controllers which provide the central control signals that orchestrate the collection of hardware devices (from SSI to VLSI) found in a digital system. An introduction to FPGA-based, as well as microprocessor-based digital systems design will be given. Design examples will include systems such as UART, microcontroller CPU, ALU and data acquisition system.",

It provides an introduction to the issues of planning in the public realm and its role in implementation of the development of municipalities through both growth as well as decline. This is achieved by examining planning theory and reflecting on the context and process of planning in practice in Canada. The student in the course will come to understand both the role of theory in guiding practice as well as the role of practice in evolution of theory. This understanding is critical to the role of the professional planner in facilitating local development and managing change in the public interest.",

The course provides an introduction to insect sampling, observation, identification, and experimentation in field settings. Student activities are divided equally between observing, collecting and identifying specimens from more than 20 families and an experimental component involving one or more studies to test hypotheses about the ecology or behaviour of insects. There are occasional lectures and discussions to highlight particularly interesting observations of insects. Student evaluation is based on the student's insect collection and associated logbook, a written paper describing their experiment, contributions to class discussions and activities, and peer evaluation. The field site is generally in the USA or South America. Course fees cover costs of room, board, supplies, and transportation to the field site(s). This course must be recorded as part of the student's Fall or Winter course selection and tuition and compulsory fees will be calculated accordingly.

Students will critically engage in the simulation using the skills that they have acquired (such as communication, research methods, and legal research skills), and will apply their substantive and conceptual understanding of law, legal process, and justice to their broader area of emphasis. Students will critically reflect on such questions as how law and legal processes shape and are shaped by broader social and political power dynamics, the degree to which law is \"political\"; and how the framing of the issue and solutions during the simulation in terms of law and justice created strategies, goals, and outcomes that may be distinct from other social and political approaches to the issue.",
