This framework is then applied to the following aspects of animal behaviour: foraging, anti-predator responses, sleep, sociality, mating, parental behaviour, play, dispersal and territoriality, animal intelligence, and behavioural pathologies.",

Students will derive an understanding of the biological foundation of their own health as an adult and will be encouraged to expand the concepts and processes of individual health to human populations, animals and the environment. Through lectures, laboratories, small group tutorials and an individual research project, students will gain an introduction to research in the health sciences. Students lacking Grade 12 or 4U Biology should consult with their program counsellor prior to taking BIOL*1080 in first semester.",

      "description": "This course will foster an understanding of key concepts in molecular and cell biology and genetics including evolution, relationship between structure and function, energy and regulation, interrelatedness of life, and the nature of science. By relating these concepts to their daily lives, through analysis of problems and tutorial discussions, students will develop an understanding of five central themes: 1) all living things share common properties, 2) the cell is the fundamental functional unit of life, 3) managing energy is central to success, 4) genes are the fundamental information unit of life, and 5) heredity. Students lacking Grade 12 or 4U Biology should consult with their program counsellor prior to taking BIOL*1090 in first semester.",

Students, working in collaboration with Indigenous peoples, will collect field samples using methods from Western scientific and Indigenous knowledge systems. Data will be analyzed to evaluate strengths and limitations of these methods and to examine factors affecting diversity and sustainable methods of land stewardship. Using knowledge gained, students will discuss and communicate their findings with diverse audien",

In addition to lectures, laboratory sessions will be devoted to practical training in analytical tools using specialized computer software and real datasets. Students will also be exposed to recent scientific literature and will undertake an independent project in order to experience these approaches in action.",

The course material will be organized around common mechanisms that link ecological processes across levels of organization, such as organism function, species interactions, spatial connectivity and energetic transfers across trophic levels. Emphasis will be on testing ecological theory with quantitative analysis of empirical data, thereby gaining greater depth of understanding of ecological processes at the population, community and ecosystem scales. Through the examination of case studies, students will apply ecological knowledge and quantitative analysis to problem solving in areas such as resource management, conservation of populations and communities, and predicting biosphere responses to climate change.",

Students independently conduct and write reports about 2 research projects of their choice and design (in consultation with faculty members), on any of: vertebrate, invertebrate, or plant ecology, and/or behaviour, in terrestrial or aquatic habitats. Emphasis is placed upon students asking ecological questions, designing experiments, and then collecting data from intensive field work. There are no formal lectures, but an organizational meeting is held in the winter semester prior to the field course. The charge by the field station for room and board will be passed on to the student. Students are also responsible for their own transportation to and from the field station. A departmental application form must be submitted for approval at least 4 weeks prior to the last day of course selection for the Summer semester, and the signature of the course coordinator will be required to select the course. This course must be recorded as part of your Fall course selection and tuition and compulsory fees will be calculated accordingly. Students taking this course DO NOT use course numbers reserved for Ontario Universities Program in Field Biology. Detailed information is available from the Department of Integrative Biology.",

The course will give an introduction to the historical developments in the discipline, explore the actions of hormones and other chemical signalling pathways, and examine processes of hormone synthesis and secretion. The focus of the course will be the integrative nature of hormone actions in the regulations of various physiological processes in animal systems, such as metabolic control, growth, and reproduction. The course will also explore aspects of \"non-classical\" endocrinology, endocrine dysfunctional states and emerging environmental concerns related to endocrine dysfunction.",
