There will be a specific emphasis on wildlife rehabilitation: its benefits, risks (to humans and animals), ethical concerns, principles of stabilization of sick and injured animals, and other key areas for consideration. Common presentations and underlying reasons for sick and injured animals that are admitted to a rehabilitation centre are presented. Whether in a wildlife centre or in the field, understanding important physiologic differences between species and how to stabilize animals for subsequent treatment by a permitted rehabilitator or a wildlife veterinarian are discussed.",

The subject of tourism development cuts across many disciplines and is fundamental to a variety of scholars and practitioners working in tourism and development generally. While a variety of important theories and planning practices from a variety of disciplines have been selected for study, planning and community development theory will provide the overarching perspective. The features of planning theories and models stress analysis and intervention into human and environmental systems. This perspective begins with the view that tourism is a complicated human construct and as such needs to be structured and guided in order to maximize the benefits to all stakeholders in the system.",

The course provides an introduction to insect sampling, observation, identification, and experimentation in field settings. Student activities are divided equally between observing, collecting and identifying specimens from more than 20 families and an experimental component involving one or more studies to test hypotheses about the ecology or behaviour of insects. There are occasional lectures and discussions to highlight particularly interesting observations of insects. Student evaluation is based on the student's insect collection and associated logbook, a written paper describing their experiment, contributions to class discussions and activities, and peer evaluation. The field site is generally in the USA or South America. Course fees cover costs of room, board, supplies, and transportation to the field site(s). This course must be recorded as part of the student's Fall or Winter course selection and tuition and compulsory fees will be calculated accordingly.

Practical applications of processing techniques (including producing different products in lab) packaging and merchandizing are emphasized in the laboratory. Other sources of animal proteins, such as eggs, are also covered. Emphasis is put on learning how various food science principles (e.g. emulsification, preservation, HACCP) are used to optimize meat products' quality and safety.",

Students will critically reflect on such questions as how law and legal processes shape and are shaped by broader social and political power dynamics, the degree to which law is \"political\"; and how the framing of the issue and solutions during the simulation in terms of law and justice created strategies, goals, and outcomes that may be distinct from other social and political approaches to the issue.",

Students will analyze the selected topic from a general One Health perspective by establishing and refining the problem and identifying key concepts and components related to animal, environmental and human health. They will then explore the potential value and impact of a One Health approach within their area of emphasis and contrast that with current practices. In the process of investigating this issue, skills such as systems thinking, communication and critical thinking will be reinforced in preparation for the independent capstone experience. Upcoming topics will be posted in advance on the One Health and CBS-ADA websites.",

The course will also assist students in understanding their position in the developing history of veterinary medicine and inform them of emerging trends. Issues related to professional development, how other species interact with humans, and the client/patient/veterinarian triad will be introduced. The application of these learned skills in the resolution of problems will be introduced.",

Students will be able to familiarize themselves with the techniques and equipment involved in various branches of marine biology and oceanography. In addition to regular tuition fees, students are responsible for the cost of transportation to St. Andrews, and for charges levied by the Huntsman Marine Science Centre for room and board. These fees are paid to Student Finance and Awards of the University of Guelph. A department application form must be submitted for approval before course selection. The signature of the course coordinator is required to select the course. This course must be recorded as part of your Fall course selection and tuition and compulsory fees will be calculated accordingly.

      "description": "This course examines the proximate and historical causes of diversity in morphology, physiology and behaviour among major groups of vertebrates (fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals). First, topics such as vertebrate origins, zoogeography, taxonomy and comparative methods will be developed as a foundation for inquiry. The remainder of the course will be organized around specific contemporary problems in vertebrate biology such as the evolution of endothermy; feeding strategies and metabolism; locomotion and migration; trends in vertebrate reproduction; evolution of brain size and complexity in relation to cognition and communication. Each problem will be explored through analyses of taxonomic diversity, historical and phylogenetic constraints, physiological and developmental causes, and functional effects.",
